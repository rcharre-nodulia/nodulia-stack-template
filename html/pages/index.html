    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Go To Hell stack</h1>

    <p class="text-sm">The "Go To Hell" stack is a modern, performance-driven development stack designed for building
      dynamic, scalable,
      and visually appealing web applications. Named for its bold approach to simplicity and speed, this stack leverages
      <strong>Golang</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>HTMX</strong> to empower developers to create
      robust full-stack solutions with
      minimal
      overhead.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://go.dev/">Golang</a></strong> offers unparalleled performance and
        simplicity for
        building highly
        concurrent,
        scalable web servers and
        APIs. Its strong typing and straightforward syntax ensure maintainability and reliability in production
        environments.</li>
      <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a></strong> provides utility-first,
        responsive design
        capabilities, allowing
        developers to
        craft elegant and
        consistent user interfaces with ease. Its customization and modularity reduce CSS bloat, improving load times
        and design flexibility.</li>
      <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a></strong> brings simplicity to client-side
        interactions by enabling seamless
        HTML-based AJAX
        requests, WebSocket
        connections, and SSE. This eliminates the need for complex JavaScript frameworks, resulting in lightweight,
        interactive user experiences.</li>
